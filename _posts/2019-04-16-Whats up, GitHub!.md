## A New Beginning
> For a true writer, each book should be a new beginning where he tries again for something that is beyond attainment. He should always try for something that has never been done or that others have tried and failed. Then sometimes, with great luck, he will succeed.

-Ernest Hemingway

From this quote, I use, to test the <http://prose.io> to test online creation of new blog posts for the github hosted blog. If this works and you are able to see the post being rendered, then, I think I am off to a good start.

Thanks & Keep in touch.
