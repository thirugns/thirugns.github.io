If you are one of those who believe democracy is one of the biggest achievement of the human society after fire and the wheel, then you are the most naive person to exist on this planet.
There was a time when power was in the hands of the mighty. Mighty in terms of brawn. The leader was decided on the ability of a person to protect the tribe.
Then came the weaklings, who also wanted a taste of the power. Ofcourse, while the dumb and brawny guy was loyal and had only the safety of the tribe as his priorities, the cunning weaklings plotted to complicate the situation. They formed alliances with the enemy tribes, traded assets in exchange of truce (not peace). This created a virtual environment, where the brawny leader seemed to be disposable. They convinced the people that they were better at governing the interests of the tribe than the beafy chap. What more, they also proposed a scheme to allow the people to participate in nominating their leader, apparently putting the power into the hands of the common man who never had ever dared to enter the ring.
With the feeling of empowerment coupled with greed they ousted their existing leader, who in fact was serving them well, and replaced him with a fraudulent system of power sharing and accountability.
